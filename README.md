# Machine Learning Lifecycle
Team Xenon employed the cutting-edge CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology in this project, ensuring a systematic and rigorous approach to data mining and machine learning.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/data mining.jpg" width="800">
</p>

Here are the steps undertaken by the team:

## ü§îü§ëBusiness Understanding:

The team commenced by gaining a deep understanding of the problem domain, which involved predicting income levels.
They defined the project goals and objectives, such as addressing income inequality through data-driven insights, aligning with industry best practices.

## üìäData Understanding:</span>

The dataset was meticulously collected from [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/income-prediction-challenge-for-azubian), which included various income-related attributes. After an in-depth overview of the initial columns, the team formulated hypotheses and key analytical questions to guide the comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

**Hypothesis:**

Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant association between the individual's age and income level.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant association between the individual's age and income level.

### Research Questions:

*How do age and gender influence income levels?*

*Does educational attainment correlate with higher income levels?*

*Is there a difference in income levels between different racial or ethnic groups?*

*How does employment status impact an individual's income level?*

*Are there regional variations in income levels, and if so, what factors contribute to these differences?*



## üî¢üé∞Data Preparation
### Feature Engineering
Team Xenon performed a rigorous feature engineering process, including unique value exploration, column renaming, missing value imputation, column dropping, target column extraction, and balancing the target column to address class imbalance, leveraging cutting-edge techniques to ensure data integrity and quality.

### Balancing The Target Variable
There was a significant class imbalance in the target variable, with a relatively small number of participants in the high-income category compared to the low-income category. This significant disparity in class distribution may have had implications for modeling and predictive accuracy. Class imbalances can lead to models that are biased toward the majority class, potentially impacting the model's ability to accurately predict the minority class (Above Limit). Team Xenon addressed this class imbalance through state-of-the-art oversampling techniques.

## ü§ñModeling
The training dataset for this income prediction problem contains numerous categorical features, some of which have a large number of unique values. This can pose challenges in terms of encoding and model performance. To address these issues, Team Xenon opted for the cutting-edge CatBoost classifier as their modeling solution:

**1. Automatic Categorical Feature Handling:** CatBoost offers a unique advantage by automatically handling categorical features. Unlike traditional models that require extensive feature encoding using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding, CatBoost can directly work with categorical data. This simplifies the preprocessing step and ensures that the team can utilize categorical features without manual intervention.

**2. Handling Missing Values:** CatBoost excels in handling missing values. It utilizes an algorithm called Symmetric Weighted Quantile Sketch (SWQS) to automatically manage missing data. This not only simplifies the preprocessing process but also reduces the risk of overfitting, contributing to improved overall model performance.

**3. Streamlined Feature Scaling:** Another benefit of CatBoost is its built-in feature scaling. It takes care of scaling all columns uniformly, saving the team the effort of manual conversion. This helps streamline the data preparation phase.

**4. Built-in Cross-Validation:** CatBoost includes a built-in cross-validation method, simplifying the task of selecting the best hyperparameters for the model. This ensures that the model's performance is optimized without the need for extensive manual tuning.

**5. Regularization Techniques:** CatBoost supports both L1 and L2 regularization methods. These techniques are valuable for reducing overfitting and enhancing the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.

By choosing CatBoost, Team Xenon aimed to efficiently address the challenges posed by the dataset, particularly the extensive set of categorical features with many unique values, which would have posed challenges during encoding. CatBoost not only simplifies the modeling process but also enhances the model's performance. It's a robust solution for the income prediction problem.

### Dataset Splitting
The team split the preprocessed training dataset into training and evaluation sets (80% training, 20% evaluation) using the industry-standard train_test_split technique.

## üîÅModel Training and Evaluation
Team Xenon achieved an impressive Accuracy of 89.38% and an F1-Score of 0.89, demonstrating the effectiveness of their modeling approach and the team's expertise in machine learning.

## Saving The Model and Key Components
The trained model, unique values, encoder, and scaler were meticulously saved in a single pickle file for later use, ensuring seamless deployment and ease of integration.

## üöÄDeployment
Team Xenon utilized the cutting-edge Streamlit framework for a user-friendly interface and the powerful FAST API for scalable predictions. This innovative architecture allows for flexibility in deployment, scalability, high performance, and easy integration.

## Why Streamlit + FastAPI?
- Asynchronous processing
- Scalability
- High performance
- Easy integration

Streamlit allows for a user-friendly interface, while FastAPI ensures scalability and high performance for global-scale predictions, providing a best-in-class solution for income prediction.

## Linking The Streamlit App with The FASTAPI
The Streamlit app was seamlessly connected with the FastAPI backend for seamless integration. A POST request was sent to the FastAPI server, the prediction response was obtained, and the prediction result was displayed to the user in real-time.

## App Layout - Homepage, Solution & EDA
The app comprises four pages: Homepage, Solution, EDA, and Prediction Page. Each page serves a specific purpose, from introducing the user to the problem to providing an interactive PowerBI dashboard and allowing for instantaneous predictions.

## App Layout - Prediction Page
The Prediction Page empowers users to input data such as age, gender, education, and more. They can submit the data and receive an instant prediction response. The page provides detailed descriptions of the different inputs and allows users to view and select them intuitively.

## FastAPI Backend
The FastAPI backend is a robust and scalable solution that accepts user input data, preprocesses it, utilizes a trained machine learning model to predict income categories, calculates prediction probability, formats the prediction result, and returns the prediction response in real-time.
